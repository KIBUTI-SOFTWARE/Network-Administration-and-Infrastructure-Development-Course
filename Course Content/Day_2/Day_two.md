## 2. Securing Network Infrastructure

### üî• Firewalls: Types and Configuration
- **Packet Filtering Firewalls**: Inspects individual packets and allows or blocks based on predefined rules.
- **Stateful Inspection Firewalls**: Monitors active connections and maintains session state for better security.
- **Proxy Firewalls**: Intermediates between client and server to enhance security and privacy.

### üåê Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Secure remote access and site-to-site connectivity.
- Configuration of **IPsec** and **SSL VPNs**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Prevention and Detection Systems (IPS/IDS)
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitors traffic and alerts for suspicious activity.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Actively blocks detected threats.
- Example tools: **Snort, Suricata, Zeek (Bro)**

### üîí End-to-End Encryption for Data Protection
- **TLS/SSL encryption** for secure data transmission.
- **IPsec for network-layer security**.

### üõ† Hands-on Lab: Configuring Firewalls and VPNs
- Implementing firewall rules using **iptables** or **pfSense**.
- Setting up a **VPN** for secure remote access.
- Deploying **Snort** for intrusion detection.

## 3. Monitoring and Troubleshooting Network Performance

### üìä Network Monitoring Tools and Techniques
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** for device monitoring.
- **NetFlow** for analyzing network traffic patterns.
- **Wireshark** for packet analysis and deep traffic inspection.

### ‚ö° Identifying Network Bottlenecks and Latency Issues
- **Ping, Traceroute, MTR** for latency measurement.
- **Bandwidth monitoring** using **iftop** or **ntopng**.

### üîç Troubleshooting Network Connectivity Problems
- Diagnosing **packet loss, high latency, and network congestion**.
- **Log analysis** from network devices.

### üõ† Hands-on Lab: Troubleshooting Common Network Issues
- Using **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network packets.
- **Simulating and mitigating a DoS attack**.
- **Detecting username & password leakage over insecure protocols**.
